ii. Co-integrated DGP
iii. Evolutionary, non-stationary DGP


B.  Knowledge Level
i. Known DGP, known $\theta$
ii. Known DGP, unknown $\theta$
iii. Unknown DGP, unknown $\theta$ 

C.  Dimensionality of the system
i. Scalar process
ii. Closed vector process
iii. Open vector process

D.  Form of analysis
i. Asymptotic analysis
ii. Finite sample results

E.  Forecast horizon

Simplest framework $\{i,i,i,i,i,i,i\}$, most realistic framework $\{iii,iii,iii,ii,ii,ii\}$

The focus of this course is time series.

## Examples of Time Series


$$ \bar{x} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N x_{i} = (x_{1} + x_{2} + x_3 + \cdots +
x_{N})/N $$

$$ Y_1 = e_1$$


```r
w =  rnorm(500,0,1)
v =  filter(w,sides=2,rep(1/3,3))
par(mfrow = c(2,1))
plot.ts(w, las = 1, col = "blue", main = "White Noise")
plot.ts(v, las = 1, col = "blue", main = "Moving Average")
```

# B. Field of Forecasting is meeting the Market Test

What is the time horizon of the forecast?

1. Short-term
2. Medium-term
3. Long-term

What do we want to forecast?

1. Every subcomponent?
2. Grouped by spatial units (states, MSAs) or totals
3. Frequency: Daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually


# C. Definitions of Time Series, Point Forecasts, and Prediction Interval Forecasts

What is a time-series?

What is a point forecast?

What are prediction interval forecasts?


# D. Evaluation of Competing Forecasting Accuracy

How to we evaluate different forecasts?

## i. Forecasting Accuracy Measures

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

$$ \mbox{MAE} = \sum_{t=t_0+h}^{T} \frac{|e_t|}{M-h+1} $$

Mean Squared Error (MSE)


$$ \mbox{MSE} = \sum_{t=t_0+h}^{T} \frac{e_t^2}{M-h+1} $$

## ii. Naive Forecasting Methods as Benchmarks
  



# E. Example: The Plano City Manager Planning Problem
