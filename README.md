# ECO 5375 - Forecasting (Fall 2017)
Forecasting Course at Southern Methodist University

# General Information 

There will be two mid-term exams, a double-point homework assignment due in lieu of a final exam, homework assignments, and class attendance. The weights of each of these items are as follows: mid-term exams (30% each), homework assignments (30%), and class attendance (10%). I will be assigning a maximum of 10 points for class attendance - 10 points for no unexcused absences, 8 points for 1 or 2 absences, and 6 points for more than 2 absences. After 4 or more absences in class attendance, I reserve the right to administratively drop the student from the class. My policy is to drop the lowest homework score you have before forming a homework average to be used in calculating your overall average in the class. The empirical project due in lieu of a final exam will be a double-point (20 points) assignment that will be included in the homework part of your grading scale. (The usual homework problems are valued at 10 points each.) Finally, you must obtain a doctor's letter if you are to be excused from any exams or homework assignments due to illness.

# Textbook for the Course

I am going to be relying more on classroom presentations and pdf handouts to teach this course than on any one textbook. I have not found any textbook that closely enough matches the topics that I think are important for this course. However, there is a nice open source (free) book that can serve as a useful supplementary textbook for this course. It is Forecasting Principles and Practice (FPP) by Rob. J. Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos. You can find it at the website https://www.otexts.org/fpp. In particular, if you are interested in learning some R programming language you should run some of the R programs that are detailed in the FPP book.

# Grading 

__My grading scale__ in this course is as follows:

* A: 92-100; 
* A-: 90-91; 
* B+: 88-89; 
* B: 82-87; 
* B-: 80-81; 
* C+: 78-79; 
* C: 72-77; 
* C-: 70-71; 
* D+: 68-69; 
* D: 62-67; 
* D-: 60-61; 
* F: 0-59.


With respect to homework exercises, students can confer with each other with respect to programming advice and discussion of basic ideas but in the final analysis each student is expected to write up his/her own homework answers and not make copies of others' homework. Copying someone else's homework to hand in as one's own work is a violation of the SMU Honor Code and will be dealt with according to the rules of the SMU Honor Code. It is important to know that the homework assignments are very important in that the basic ideas covered by them invariably show up on the mid-term and final exams. If you know you are going to be missing a class on the day a homework exercise is due, hand in your homework __in advance__ to receive full credit for your work.

Any homework that is handed in late will be given a one letter grade reduction for each day of tardiness. It is my policy to drop your lowest exercise score before calculating your exercise average.

Students will be excused from taking the mid-term exam or the final exam only with a note from a physician, or in the case of a death in the family, with a note from a parent or guardian. Even with an excused absence, either of these exams must eventually be taken before a course grade will be assigned to the student.

If you must miss a class due to legitimate circumstances beyond your control, be sure and contact me __beforehand__ so that I will know of your circumstances. If excused, I will correspondingly excuse you from any QQ that is given that day. I want to emphasize that diligent attendance in this course is essential because a lot of the course material presented in class will be from my personal class notes and can't be found in any textbook per se. __Note:__ After 4 unexcused class absences, I reserve the right to administratively drop students from the class.
