# A. Focus of this Course: Time Series Forecasting

The focus of this course is time series. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
series1 <- runif(1000)
plot(series1,las=1,type="l",col="blue",main="Random Drawns",ylab="",xlab="index")
```

## Examples of Time Series


$$ Y_1 = e_1$$

```{r}
w =  rnorm(500,0,1)
v =  filter(w,sides=2,rep(1/3,3))
par(mfrow = c(2,1))
plot.ts(w, las = 1, col = "blue", main = "White Noise")
plot.ts(v, las = 1, col = "blue", main = "Moving Average")

```
